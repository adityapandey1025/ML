#### Machine Learning
Let’s understand this concept with an example. Suppose you have an image of a cat and you ask the computer what breed it belongs to. Here, you are not going to tell the computer something like, _“if the cat’s color is white, it may be Serbian; if the color is orange, it may be an orange breed.”_  
Instead, you provide lots of data or images of different breeds of cats to your model. Based on this data, and after training, the model will be able to predict the breed of the cat. This process is called Machine Learning.

**ML (Machine Learning)** is a branch of **AI** where computers learn from data and improve their predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed with fixed rules.

#### Types Of ML -> (diagram is given below)
* ### **Supervised Learning**

- **Definition:** The model is trained using **labeled data**, which means every input has a corresponding correct output.
    
- **How it works:** The model learns the relationship between input and output, then uses this knowledge to predict outputs for new inputs.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - Input: Size of a house, number of rooms, location.
        
    - Output: Price of the house.
        
    - The model learns from past data and predicts the price of a new house.
        
- **Use cases:** Email spam detection, stock price prediction, medical diagnosis.

* ### **Unsupervised Learning**

- **Definition:** The model is trained using **unlabeled data**, meaning only inputs are given without correct answers.
    
- **How it works:** The algorithm finds hidden patterns, groups, or structures in the data.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - A shopping website analyzes customer purchase history.
        
    - The algorithm groups customers into segments (e.g., gadget lovers, clothing buyers) without being told what those groups are.
        
- **Use cases:** Customer segmentation, market basket analysis, anomaly detection (fraud detection).

* ### **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**

- **Definition:** The model (called an **agent**) learns by interacting with an **environment**. It takes actions, receives **rewards or penalties**, and improves its strategy.
    
- **How it works:** The agent learns a policy (best strategy) to maximize long-term rewards.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - A robot learning to walk:
        
        - If it moves correctly → reward.
            
        - If it falls → penalty.
            
    - Over time, it learns the best way to walk.
        
- **Use cases:** Game AI (like AlphaGo), self-driving cars, robotics, recommendation systems.
